# Frontend Mentor - Single-page design portfolio solution

This is a solution to the [Single-page design portfolio challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-design-portfolio-2MMhyhfKVo). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

In this project, I explored the creation of a functional gallery utilizing the new tool, Swiper, which prioritizes accessibility (a11y). Through this endeavor, I aimed to deepen my understanding of exceptional user experiences and inclusive design principles.

## Overview

This project provided me with invaluable insights into the intricacies of creating user-centric galleries. Through the incorporation of custom animations, I have not only expanded my technical skill set but also enriched the overall usability and appeal of the project. I introduced several bespoke animations to imbue the project with a dynamic and visually appealing flair. These animations not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also contribute to a more engaging user experience.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See some enjoyable CSS animations

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css and its transitions
.person-container__background {
  position: absolute;
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  object-fit: cover;
  inset: auto 0 0;
}
.person-container__avatar {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  overflow: hidden;
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  transition: transform 450ms ease-in-out;
}
.person-container__avatar:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```
